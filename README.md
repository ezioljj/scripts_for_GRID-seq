scripts for analyses of GRID-seq

Introduction

Welcome to GRID-seq RNA-DNA interactome mapping library!

GRID-seq is a novel method for genome-wide detection of RNA-DNA interactions in chromatin. The pipeline was originally developed by Xiao Li et al in "GRI D-seq reveals the global RNAâ€“chromatin interactome". Here we add some extra scripts to make a supplement.
